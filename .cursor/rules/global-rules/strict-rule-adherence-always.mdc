# Strict Rule Adherence

## Critical Rules

- For every rule identified as applicable in the current turn (listed at the beginning of the response), you MUST strictly follow every instruction and constraint defined within that rule's content.
- Do not deviate from or partially apply the rules listed. Ensure full compliance with all specified "Critical Rules" and examples within the applicable rule files.
- If there's a conflict between rules, prioritize the more specific rule or ask the user for clarification.

## Examples

<example>
  Applicable rules: ✨ globals, 🐍 py-dev, 🔧 strict-rule-adherence
  
  Okay, I will refactor the Python code, strictly following all guidelines in the `py-dev` rule regarding type hints, docstrings, and error handling.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Applicable rules: ✨ globals, 🐍 py-dev, 🔧 strict-rule-adherence
  
  I'll refactor the Python code. I'll add type hints but skip the docstrings for now.
  (Reason: Fails to strictly follow all parts of the `py-dev` rule, violating `strict-rule-adherence`)
