# Display Applicable Rules

## Critical Rules

- At the beginning of each response, list the Cursor rules applicable to the current query context.
- Use the format: "Applicable rules:" followed by a list of `emoji + short rule name`.
- Use concise, relevant emojis for each rule category (e.g., 🐍 for Python, 💾 for Git, 🔧 for Core).
- If only global rules (like this one) apply, state "Applicable rules: ✨ globals".
- If other specific rules apply, list them alongside the global indicator if appropriate, e.g., "Applicable rules: ✨ globals, 🐍 py-dev".

## Examples

<example>
  Applicable rules: ✨ globals, 🐍 py-dev, 💾 git-commit
